## Building an Image Based on a Dockerfile
To build an image from a `Dockerfile`, use the following command:

```bash
docker build .
```

### Explanation
- The builder pulls the base image (if needed) and runs the instructions specified in the `Dockerfile`.
- Using this command, the image will have no name, but the output will provide the ID of the image.

### Running a Container from the Built Image
Using the image ID from the build output, you can start a container:

```bash
docker run <image-id>
```

## Tagging Images
Tagging is the method of assigning a memorable name to an image.

### Tagging During Build
To tag an image while building, add the `-t` or `--tag` flag:

```bash
docker build -t my-username/my-image .
```

### Adding a Tag to an Existing Image
If you've already built an image, you can add another tag to it using:

```bash
docker image tag my-username/my-image another-username/another-image:v1
```

## Publishing Images
Once your image is built and tagged, you can push it to a registry.

### Push Command
To push an image to a registry, use the following command:

```bash
docker push my-username/my-image
```

### Process
Within a few seconds, all the layers of your image will be pushed to the registry.
